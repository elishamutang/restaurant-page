# Oriental Kopi Clone (Restaurant Page Project from TOP)
Project from The Odin Project's JavaScript course

The project mainly emphasizes on the application of NPM, webpack and building the webpage using only DOM manipulation in JavaScript.


# To run, please do the following

- Since the page is incomplete, run `npm run dev` to have a look at the website.


## Note-to-self

- In dist folder, place images in a separate folder for clealiness.

### Future Improvements

- Use 2 columns instead of just 1, for accessibility purposes.
